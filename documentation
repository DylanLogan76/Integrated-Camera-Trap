Install Raspbian OS from the Official Raspberry Pi Website : https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
We recommend the version with Desktop

To install the Raspbian OS on the microSD card, we recommend to use Etcher : https://www.balena.io/etcher/

Install the camera and PIR sensor on the Pi

The default username is "pi" and the default password is "raspberry"

You can change the password for user "pi" if you want, but it is not neccessary

Read this to see how to change the password for a user: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/users.md

If you are using a Headless Raspbian OS without a GUI/Desktop: 
	edit XKBLAYOUT line in /etc/default/keyboard from "gb" to "us"

Follow these instructions to set up Wi-Fi depending on your setup: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/
If you are using a Desktop, follow Desktop
Else, follow the Command Line

if you need to edit the wpa_supplicant.conf file to connect a network, add this to the bottom
----------------------------------------------------------------
network={
	ssid="<name of Wifi Network>"
	psk="<Password for that Wifi Network>"
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Depending on your Wi-Fi network configurations, you might need to add extra parameters to connect, see the documentation for more details
http://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/plain/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf - Documentation for wpa_supplicant.conf

Connect to the Internet first and type in the following in the command line and type "y" when asked to install the following:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
	sudo apt-get install python-pip
	sudo pip install paho-mqtt
	sudo apt-get install ftpd
	sudo pip install gpiozero
	sudo pip install picamera
	sudo apt-get install fbi
	sudo apt-get install sshpass
	sudo pip install pyserial
	sudo pip install schedule
	sudo pip install adafruit-mcp3008
	sudo apt-get install python-paramiko

SSH (protocol to log into Pi remotely) is disabled by default, we need to enable SSH
to enable SSH:
	1. type "sudo raspi-config" in the command line
	2. Select 5.Interfacing Options
	3. Select P2 SSH
	4. reboot the pi by typing "sudo reboot" in the command line
SSH in now enabled and you can SSH into the Pi from any device using a software client or through command line (https://man.openbsd.org/ssh)
List of SSH clients:
	PuTTY (Windows only)
	SecureCRT
	Termius

FTP or SCP the neccessary files for each Pi
We recommend an FTP or SCP client:
	WinSCP (Windows only)
	Filezilla
	Cyberduck
		
The camera is disabled by default, we need to enable Camera
to enable camera:
	1. type "sudo raspi-config" in the command line
	2. Select 5.Interfacing Options
	3. Select P1 Camera
	4. reboot the pi by typing "sudo reboot" in the command line
The Camera is now enabled and working
If you want to test the camera, run test_camera.py to see if it can take a photo "test_photo.jpg"										

To add and connect to the Raspberry Pi access point, connect to the "CTWifi" network and put in the password you chose for the network
the default, recommended password was "cameratrap"

In the main source code folder, type in the command "sudo chmod 777 ./*" and "sudo chown pi ./*" to run all files as user pi without root permissions

Make a directory called cameraTrapPhotos in the same directory as the source code.

Make sure python or python3 is installed on your OS by typing in "python --version", if returns nothing, then you need to install python for Linux https://www.python.org/downloads/source/

Type "python <name of python file>" to run the code
